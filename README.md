# A simple (C like) compiler
A simple compiler written from scratch in c++.
It supports C like syntax with some changes. The CFG can be viewed [here](https://github.com/gendestry/Compiler/blob/master/lang.syn).

## Current stage
At this moment the compiler creates a tree by doing syntax analysis.
It then resolves names and types.
There are probably many bugs left to squash.

The development is done on the dev branch.
